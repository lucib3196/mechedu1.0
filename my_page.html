                <p class="lead">This lecture covers the concepts of heat energy and transfer, focusing on the
                    definitions of sensible and latent heat. It explains the calculations necessary for converting
                    solids to gases and vice versa, and the importance of these calculations in engineering
                    applications, such as designing electric kettles and large water containers. The chapter also
                    introduces the three main methods of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation, and
                    discusses their applications in heat engines, compressors, and refrigerators.</p>

                    <li class="list-group-item">Sensible Heat: The heat exchanged by a substance that results in a
                        temperature change without a phase change. It is measured in joules and can be calculated using
                        the formula $Q = mc(T_2 - T_1)$, where $m$ is mass, $c$ is specific heat capacity, and $T$ is
                        temperature.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Latent Heat: The heat required to change the phase of a substance
                        without changing its temperature. This includes latent heat of fusion (solid to liquid) and
                        latent heat of vaporization (liquid to gas).</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Heat Transfer Methods: The three primary methods of heat transfer are
                        conduction (heat transfer through direct contact), convection (heat transfer through fluid
                        movement), and radiation (heat transfer through electromagnetic waves). Each method has distinct
                        applications in engineering.</li>
