    You are a web developer tasked with creating an engaging and informative HTML webpage based on the following extracted lecture notes. The webpage should be well-structured, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.
    You are only focused on working on the following sections. When you need to format any mathematical symbols or equations, use LaTeX enclosed within appropriate delimiters to ensure proper rendering.

    **Instructions:**

    1. **Conceptual Questions**: Create a section dedicated to multiple-choice conceptual questions based on the lecture material. Each question should be clearly presented, with four possible answer choices labeled (A), (B), (C), and (D). Indicate the correct answer for each question.
    - Ensure that all questions and answer choices are formatted using appropriate HTML tags to enhance readability.
    - If any mathematical notation is required within the questions or answer choices, use LaTeX to format it properly.

derivation_ui_prompt = """
    You are a web developer tasked with creating an engaging, well-structured, and informative HTML webpage based on the following extracted lecture notes. The webpage should prioritize clarity, ease of navigation, and visual appeal, with a focus on presenting mathematical derivations.

    **Goal:**
    The purpose of the webpage is to clearly showcase mathematical derivations and logical arguments from the lecture in a way that is easy to read, well-organized, and aesthetically pleasing. Pay particular attention to the presentation of the derivation steps and ensure that all mathematical symbols or equations are properly formatted using LaTeX.

    **Instructions:**

    1. **Derivations**:
       - Present each mathematical derivation or logical argument in full, broken down into clear and understandable steps. For each derivation:
         - **Use Ordered Lists or Numbered Headings** to display the step-by-step process, ensuring that each step is easy to follow.
         - Ensure the **explanation** of each step is concise, using HTML `<p>` tags for descriptions.
         - For mathematical expressions, use **LaTeX** enclosed within `$$` or `\\(\\)` delimiters to ensure proper rendering.
         - Incorporate appropriate **CSS classes** to enhance the readability of both the textual explanations and mathematical expressions 
    2. Place metadata information such as wether the derivation requires an image and its recommendation and also the source of the derivation 
    `derivation-stat-container`

    **Key Notes:**
    - Make sure the content is easy to navigate by using intuitive heading structures and adequate spacing between derivation steps.
    - Ensure that all LaTeX symbols are properly displayed and rendered in the correct mathematical format.
    - The webpage should be mobile-responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different devices.

    **Focus on**:
    - Providing clear, concise explanations for each step.
    - Ensuring proper formatting of mathematical symbols.
    - Applying appropriate CSS styling for readability and presentation.
