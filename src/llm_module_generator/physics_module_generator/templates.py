1. Analyze the Question
Begin by carefully reading the physics question to determine its natureâ€”whether it demands computational solutions or is purely theoretical. 
This initial analysis is critical as it dictates the necessity of incorporating placeholders for numerical values. 
Consider the context and specifics of the question thoroughly to ensure the correct categorization.

2. Identify Parameters for Computation
For questions requiring computational analysis:
Identify all numerical values that could potentially vary or would be essential for calculations. This step is paramount and must be prioritized for computational questions.
Replace these values with placeholders using the format {{params.variable_name}}. Ensure you choose descriptive and unique names for each variable to prevent any confusion and to clearly indicate their roles in the computations.

3. Emphasize Placeholder Implementation
The implementation of placeholders is a key aspect of converting physics questions into interactive HTML files. Whenever you encounter a numerical value in a computational question:

Immediately consider it for conversion into a placeholder. For instance, if the question involves a distance traveled over time, convert specific numerical values like "100 meters" and "5 seconds" into {{params.distance}} and {{params.time}}, respectively.
 Ensure that every numerical parameter in the question is accounted for and represented by a placeholder, which will allow for dynamic interaction when the HTML is used.
4. Analyze the Examples
You are provided with a set of examples showcasing the implementation of similar questions:
Analyze these examples critically and revisit the instructions to understand their approaches and outcomes.
Adapt the best practices from these examples to the question at hand, ensuring that placeholders are effectively used to allow end-users to manipulate the variables and explore different computational results.

Additionally, only include files if you are given  the path to the file directly

    Design a robust JavaScript module capable of generating computational problems across various STEM disciplines. This module will ingest an HTML file containing a structured query and output a JavaScript snippet that performs the calculations for the described problem. The JavaScript code must conform to the following outline:
    Additionally, the only JavaScript library you are allowed to import is the mathjs library.
    You do not have access to any external files. If needed, generate a small data structure containing a maximum of five properties, such as tabular data for chemical, material, or fluid properties, to demonstrate that the code works.

        // 1. Dynamic Parameter Selection:
        // - Thoroughly analyze the HTML or data source to identify an extensive range of categories and units for computation.
        // - Ensure the inclusion of a wide variety of units and values, covering different global measurement systems.
        // - Develop a randomized selection algorithm to fairly choose a category or unit system, ensuring equitable representation.
        // - When applicable, ensure that it alternates between SI and USCS for unit selection.

        // 2. Value Generation:
        // - Produce random values relevant to the problem's context, ensuring they fall within specified ranges.
        // - Define static ranges for value generation to avoid conversion issues later on.
        // - When applicable and given the chance to include both SI and USCS, choose to define static values within a specified range rather than converting them later.
        // - Account for both SI and USCS unit systems when applicable, generating appropriate values for each system.

        **Important Note on Unit Conversion:**
        - Do not convert between SI and USCS unless directly stated in the problem. The code should only apply unit conversions within the specified system. Ensure that each problem instance adheres to this rule to maintain accuracy and consistency
        - Do not convert the values when it is not needed for solution synthesis ie do not convert SI values to USCS and vise versa
        // 3. Solution Synthesis:
        // - Utilize the selected parameters and the generated values to formulate the solution.
        // - Apply any necessary unit conversions.

            // be used for the HTML integration. Ensure that any converted values are also exported if conversions are performed.
