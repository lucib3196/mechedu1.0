1. Analyze the Question
Begin by carefully reading the physics question to determine its natureâ€”whether it demands computational solutions or is purely theoretical. 
This initial analysis is critical as it dictates the necessity of incorporating placeholders for numerical values. 
Consider the context and specifics of the question thoroughly to ensure the correct categorization.

2. Identify Parameters for Computation
For questions requiring computational analysis:
Identify all numerical values that could potentially vary or would be essential for calculations. This step is paramount and must be prioritized for computational questions.
Replace these values with placeholders using the format {{params.variable_name}}. Ensure you choose descriptive and unique names for each variable to prevent any confusion and to clearly indicate their roles in the computations.

3. Emphasize Placeholder Implementation
The implementation of placeholders is a key aspect of converting physics questions into interactive HTML files. Whenever you encounter a numerical value in a computational question:

Immediately consider it for conversion into a placeholder. For instance, if the question involves a distance traveled over time, convert specific numerical values like "100 meters" and "5 seconds" into {{params.distance}} and {{params.time}}, respectively.
 Ensure that every numerical parameter in the question is accounted for and represented by a placeholder, which will allow for dynamic interaction when the HTML is used.
4. Analyze the Examples
You are provided with a set of examples showcasing the implementation of similar questions:
Analyze these examples critically and revisit the instructions to understand their approaches and outcomes.
Adapt the best practices from these examples to the question at hand, ensuring that placeholders are effectively used to allow end-users to manipulate the variables and explore different computational results.


Analysis: The question is a multiple-choice question that asks students to identify the correct option for the maximum efficiency of a propeller, as derived in lecture slides. To effectively convert this question into an online quiz format, we need to apply specific HTML tags to enhance the interactivity and clarity of the question. The question type is straightforward, as it requires students to select one correct answer from various options, which aligns perfectly with the use of the `pl-multiple-choice` tag. The question's nature doesn't require any graphical elements, symbolic inputs, or specific units, so those tags are unnecessary here.
Element Name: pl-multiple-choice
Reasoning: This tag is ideal for presenting the question as a multiple-choice question, where students select one correct answer from a few options. It uses radio buttons to allow single selection, which aligns with the quiz's requirement to pick only one correct option. Randomizing the order of answers helps prevent any bias related to answer order.
Tag Examples: 
<pl-question-panel>
<p>
A ball with mass $m ={{params.m}}\rm\ kg$ is thrown downward from the top of a building with height $h = {{params.h}}\rm\ m$ and initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal as shown in the figure. The $x$-component of the initial velocity $v_{x0} = {{params.v0x}}\rm\ m/s$, and the ball hits the ground a distance $d = {{params.d}}\rm\ m$ from the building as shown in the figure.
