        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
            The STEM Module Generator is designed to help educators create adaptive quizzes and content for STEM disciplines, with a focus on mechanical engineering subjects.
            Our platform generates modules containing multiple files, including HTML for solutions and step-by-step guides, and JavaScript for computation and value generation.

    <!-- Generators Section -->
    <section class="mt-5">
        <h3>Generators</h3>
        <p>Our platform offers three types of generators to meet your needs:</p>

        <h4>1. Text Generator</h4>
        <p>This tool works best with simple questions. It is faster and ideal for quick tests. Just type your question and get an instant response. Feel free to experiment with the complexity of the questions to see what works best.</p>

        <h4>2. Image Input Generator</h4>
        <p>This generator is ideal for more complex questions that are represented visually. Upload an image of your lecture notes, handwritten work, or textbook solutions, and the platform will generate content based on the provided image.</p>

        <h4>3. Lecture Analysis Tool</h4>
        <p>The Lecture Analysis Tool is our most advanced generator. It analyzes a collection of documents, typically lecture notes, and decides on key options for extraction. This tool can extract key concepts and fundamental ideas, generate conceptual questions, identify mathematical derivations, and create computational questions. Essentially, it combines the capabilities of the first two generators, generating all necessary modules and creating an HTML webpage of the lecture material.</p>

    <!-- Important Notice Section -->
    <section class="mt-5">
        <h3>Important Notice</h3>
        <p>
            While our STEM Module Generator is designed to provide quick and efficient creation of educational modules based on user input, it is important to note that 
            the generated content is not guaranteed to be perfect, as there can be inaccuracies or areas that need improvement.
        </p>

        <h4>Why Review is Necessary</h4>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The generated modules might contain factual errors or misinterpretations of the input question. It is crucial to verify the accuracy of the content to ensure it meets your specific requirements and standards.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Relevance:</strong> The generated content might not always be fully aligned with the intended context or specific nuances of the question. Reviewing helps to tailor the content more precisely to your needs.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Quality:</strong> Automated generation can sometimes result in content that lacks the depth, clarity, or coherence required for effective learning. Reviewing allows for refinement and enhancement of the material.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Customization:</strong> Each educational context is unique. Reviewing and editing the generated modules enable customization to better fit the specific learning objectives and audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3">
            By thoroughly reviewing and refining the generated modules before deployment, you can ensure that the content is accurate, relevant, high-quality, and customized to your needs. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your educational materials.
