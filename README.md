# GESTALT QUESTION GENERATOR

## Welcome

The STEM Module Generator is designed to help educators create adaptive quizzes and content for STEM disciplines, with a focus on mechanical engineering subjects. Our platform generates modules containing multiple files, including HTML for solutions and step-by-step guides, and JavaScript for computation and value generation.

## Features

- Instant Generation of Adaptive Content
- Process both text and image inputs
- Automatic Unit Conversion and Random Value Generation

## How It Works

1. **Enter your question** in the input box.
2. **Click the "Generate" button**.
3. **Review and download** your custom module.

## Generators

Our platform offers two types of generators to meet your needs:

### 1. Text Generator

This tool works best with simple questions. It is faster and ideal for quick tests. Just type your question and get an instant response. Feel free to experiment with the complexity of the questions to see what works best.

### 2. Advanced Solution Generator

For more complex questions, it is recommended to use the Advanced Solution Generator. This generator takes in both the question and its solution as an image containing a step-by-step guide. It has a much better chance of providing the correct answer, especially for more complex problems.

## Important Notice:

While our STEM Module Generator is designed to provide quick and efficient creation of educational modules based on user input, it is important to note that the generated content is not guaranteed to be perfect, as there can be inaccuracies or areas that need improvement.

### Why Review is Necessary

- **Accuracy**: The generated modules might contain factual errors or misinterpretations of the input question. It is crucial to verify the accuracy of the content to ensure it meets your specific requirements and standards.
- **Relevance**: The generated content might not always be fully aligned with the intended context or specific nuances of the question. Reviewing helps to tailor the content more precisely to your needs.
- **Quality**: Automated generation can sometimes result in content that lacks the depth, clarity, or coherence required for effective learning. Reviewing allows for refinement and enhancement of the material.
- **Customization**: Each educational context is unique. Reviewing and editing the generated modules enable customization to better fit the specific learning objectives and audience.

By thoroughly reviewing and refining the generated modules before deployment, you can ensure that the content is accurate, relevant, high-quality, and customized to your needs. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your educational materials.

## Powered by OpenAI

Our generators use OpenAI's GPT models to create content. These advanced language models help in generating accurate and relevant educational materials based on your input questions.

## Installation

To install and run the STEM Module Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stem-module-generator.git
   cd stem-module-generator
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. **Install the Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

This will start a local web server. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the STEM Module Generator.
